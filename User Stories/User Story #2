Feature: Navigating a Floor Plan

Story:As a freshman who wants to find my way to the library during breaks, I open the app to determine the way from my location to the library and reuse it.

Acceptance Tests:
1. Open the app, and wait for the splash screen to appear
2. Sign in with account after the splash screen. 
3. Click on the navigate icon. 
4. The app will determine my location and place a floor plan if I am at a location with floor plans available.
5. Then I will click a point that I want to navigate to on the floor plan.
5. The app will calculate the route and display it on my screen.
6. When I move, the user's current location and route will update.
7. When I am there, the app will say that I am there.
