FEATURE: The ability to save routes

Story: As a freshman who wants to find my way to the library during breaks,
I open the app to determine the way from my location to the library and reuse it.

Actions:
1. Open the app
2. Click on the route icon
3. The app will determine my location
4. Then I will enter in my desired destination
5. The app will calculate the route and display it on my screen
6. I will click on the option to save route
7. When I go to "saved routes" in the menu panel, this path will be there for next time
