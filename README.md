# UBLost
UBLost is web app intended for students and visitors of University at Buffalo. The universityâ€™s north campus can be daunting and confusing for people, especially when it comes to finding specific buildings and rooms. Google Maps only helps identify the location of buildings, but our team intends to expand this service. UBLost provides an in-depth navigation system that will guide students around the interior of the buildings around campus. The goal is to allow them to easily find where they need to go in an efficient and stress-free way.
