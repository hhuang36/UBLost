# UBLost
UBLost is mobile app intended for students, faculty and visitors at the University at Buffalo. The universityâ€™s North Campus can be daunting and confusing for people, especially when it comes to finding specific buildings and rooms. While Google Maps only helps identify the location of buildings, our team intends to expand this service. UBLost provides an in-depth navigation system that will guide students around the interior of the buildings around campus. The goal is to allow them to easily find where they need to go in an efficient and stress-free way.
